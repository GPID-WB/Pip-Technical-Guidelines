## Install VScode and Stata Extensions
1. Open "Company Portal" app on your computer.
2. Search for [VS Code](companyportal:ApplicationId=d5aba730-00d4-4a78-a224-7b8170ac0eb0) and install it.
3. Search for [GitForWindows](companyportal:ApplicationId=b9da6be7-f510-438d-9fd0-b1df8213b3c6) and install it.

4. Open VScode, go to Extensions (left sidebar), and install:
   - "Stata Enhanced" by Adam Mezzetti
   - "Code Runner" by Jun Han
   - "Git Graph" by mhutchie
   - "GitLens" by Eric Amodio
   - "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" by GitHub
   - "Github Copilot" by GitHub
   - "Github Copilot Chat" by GitHub


## Configure `Rundo` and `Rundoline` files
All the information of this section is taken from Friedrich Hueble's [blog post](https://huebler.blogspot.com/2008/04/stata.html). So if you need more details, please refer to it.
1. Although these files are available at Hueble's website above, we also make them available for convenience [here](https://github.com/GPID-WB/Pip-Technical-Guidelines/raw/refs/heads/main/_data/rundofiles.zip)
2. Extract the contents of the zip file in `C:\ado\personal`. The zip file contains six files, you will modify ONLY two of them:
   - `Rundo.ini`
   - `Rundoline.ini`
3. Open the `Rundo.ini` file in Notepad or VScode (or any text editor) and make the following changes:
   - Change the `stata_path` to the path of your Stata installation (e.g., `c:\Program Files\StataNow19\StataMP-64.exe`).
   - Modify the `statawin` to the exact title of your Stata installation. In my case, it is "StataNow/MP 19.5". The window title is shown in the center or left corner of the title bar of the main Stata program window.

   - You can leave the other settings as they are. But if you want to customize further, refer to the blog post linked above.
4. Open the `Rundoline.ini` and copy ALL the contents of the `Rundo.ini` file into the `Rundoline.ini` file. Basically, both files are identical except for the name. 


## Configure Stata Enhanced Extension
1. Open VScode settings (File > Preferences > Settings) or type `Ctrl + ,`.
2. Search for "Run Code configuration" and click on it in the left panel. Or type "@ext:formulahendry.code-runner" so you get directly. Now configure the following settings:
   - **Stata Path:** Set the path to your Stata executable (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Stata17\StataSE.exe`).
   - **Stata Arguments:** Add any command-line arguments you want to use (e.g., `-b` for batch mode).
