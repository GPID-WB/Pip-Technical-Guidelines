## Purpose and Principles {.unnumbered}

GitHub Copilot is a powerful assistant that can increase productivity, generate boilerplate code quickly, and support experimentation. However, Copilot is not a substitute for engineering judgment, critical thinking, or expertise in R/Stata. This document establishes:

-   **Protocols** (mandatory actions) → must be followed and demonstrated during reviews.
-   **Guidelines** (recommended practices) → encourage effective, responsible use of AI.

Our goals:

1.  Improve productivity.
2.  Ensure robustness, maintainability, and security of code.
3.  Strengthen—not replace—team members’ coding skills.
4.  Prevent dependency creep, hallucinations, inefficiencies, and silent errors.

## PROTOCOLS (Mandatory Requirements)

Every team member **must** follow these protocols when using Copilot for technical work. Team leads will verify compliance during code reviews.

### **Protocol 1 — Documenting Your Work With Copilot**

**Objective:** We want every piece of Copilot-assisted work to be transparent, easy to review, and easy to understand—not only for you, but for anyone who touches the code later. Think of this as keeping a clear trail of “why we did what we did,” without drowning anyone in hundreds of lines of chat history.

#### **Start Every Copilot-Assisted Task With a Quick Declaration** {.unnumbered}

Whenever you’re about to use Copilot for something a particular task (specially the ones assigned to you), like rewriting a function, adding a feature, building tests, refactoring, among others, just let Copilot know you’re starting a task.

You can use this short message (literally "copy and paste." Just change the TASK_NAME):

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="simple"}
## Prompt

I’m starting Task: TASK_NAME. Please keep a concise running summary of our interaction, including:

- the major prompts I give
- the important decisions we make
- any dependencies added or removed
- assumptions or limitations we identify At the end I’ll ask you to produce a markdown summary.
:::

Why do this? Because Copilot won’t track your whole conversation unless you tell it to. This little habit guarantees that your final summary is clean and complete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Keep the Summary Updated as You Go (But Keep It Light)** {.unnumbered}

As you work, Copilot may try several ideas, produce alternatives, or suggest changes. When something important happens, simply say:

-   “Add this to the summary: we switched to data.table for speed.”
-   “Add this: the first approach was rejected because it created too many dependencies.”
-   “Record that we decided to remove purrr and use collapse instead.”

You don’t need to log every micro-step—just the meaningful ones.

This keeps your future self (and your reviewers) very happy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **When You Finish, Ask Copilot for a Clean Markdown Summary** {.unnumbered}

Once the task is done, ask Copilot: 

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}

## Prompt

Now generate a markdown summary of this task, including: 
- What the task was about 
- The key prompts I used 
- The major decisions or explanations you gave 
- Dependencies that were added, removed, or questioned 
- Any limitations or follow-up steps 
- The final version of the function or script 
- A short checklist showing how I followed the protocol 

Save this file as: `copilot_logs/TASK_NAME.md` 

:::

and include it in your Pull Request.

This takes Copilot a few seconds and keeps our PRs tidy, transparent, and genuinely "reviewable."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Prompt Files Are Optional Tools, Not Documentation** {.unnumbered}

Copilot has something called **Prompt Files**, which lets you save reusable instructions like:

-   “Use data.table, not dplyr.”
-   “Follow collapse idioms.”
-   “Write tests using testthat.”

These are great for giving Copilot consistent context, but they *don’t* replace the documentation required above.

Use them if they help you, but they’re optional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Final Thought** {.unnumbered}

This protocol isn’t about bureaucracy. It’s about making sure that Copilot becomes a *collaborator*, not a shadow author.

When you keep a clear record of the interaction, everyone on the team benefits—your reviewers, the teammates who maintain your code, and you in the future.

And yes: you’ll get faster at this than you think. After a few tasks, it becomes second nature and saves you time rather than adding work.
