# How to upgrade R


R saves packages from minor versions and above. 

set the .Renviron to read from a defined folder

Before upgrading you should save the name of all the packages 


```{r}
#| eval: false
pdkgs_names <- installed.packages() |> 
    _[,1]
save
```


Ideally, once you have upgraded you should start a vanilla R sessions

```{r}
#| eval: false
.Last <- function() system("R --vanilla")
```

Once you have restarted the R session and are working now in a vanilla session, you have to remove the `.Last()` function if you don't want to work on vanilla forever.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rm(.Last) 
```
